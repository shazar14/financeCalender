TODO financeCalendar:
	* Be able to edit all the monthly bills on the Edit Bill page
	DONE * Add functionality to be able to add a new bill on the Add Bill page
	DONE * Be able to add a new payable account, or mark a existing bill account as a payable account
	* Bill Analytics? new tab? 
		* was thinking maybe move the calendar to the left and run some basic bill stats (monthly and weekly totals, maybe total bills left for the month, others?) on the right side of the page


Security:
	* Validate input from the change bill page (as well as the other add and edit pages when they are implemented)
	* access restrictions?


Bugs:
	* Fix design layout of changeBill
	* If you drag a bill to the next month, it changes the next months bill instead of the one you dragged
	* sat does not load properly.  Need to resize window to get it to load properly
	* Reload editBills table each time the tab is clicked
		-> currently it is not loading anything after the first time the table is built (needs to be destroyed and recreated each time)
